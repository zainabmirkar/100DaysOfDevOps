# CloudTrail

- CloudTrail is active in your AWS account when you create it and doesn't require any manual setup. When activity occurs in your AWS account, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event.
- tracks api request, non api requests.. these requests can be made from cli, console
- ```Events```: 1) management events, data events and ctrail insight events
- ```Management events``` also known as ```Control Plane Operations``` example ```createdatabase api```  or createuser api or ```non api evenst such as user signing in```
- ```Data events ``` resource operations such as ```s3 getobject, putobject```
- ```Ctrail insight events``` for ```unusual activity``` within your account
- ```Event history``` The Event history provides a viewable, searchable, downloadable, and immutable record of the past 90 days of management events in an AWS Region.

### Cloudtrail Trails
- Trails capture a record of AWS activities, delivering and storing these events in an ```Amazon S3 bucket```, with optional delivery to ```Amazon CloudWatch Logs``` and Amazon  ```EventBridge```.
- 3 diff types:
- ```all region trail``` applies to all the regions within aws account and deliver to s3.. enables to record events across the enitre aws account .. highly recommended
- ```single region trail``` in a single region.. each single region trail can deliver logs to seperate buckets
- ``` aws organization trail```captures all events from all accounts.. member accounts will only have the view of log files and trails.. they wont be able to edit the configuration in any way
