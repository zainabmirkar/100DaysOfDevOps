## Direct Connect

- we have a data center
- aws partner/customer holds dc infrastructure so there are 2 parts to this one is aws and other is customer
- and then there is aws region. direct connect connects to an aws region not just a vpc
- inside a region there is a vpc
- dc allows to connet public as well as private sources
- there are 2 interfaces ... public and private
- vgw connected to vpc. private interface will be connected to vgw (private resources)
